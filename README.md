# UFOs
Javascript, VSC, Script, and MongoDB
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Overview
Dana has a webpage that provides information of a table about UFO information. In order for the webpage to work in a user friendly manner, she would like to change some features. By adding the feature of filtering to the webpage like for the state, date, shape, and country.


## Results
### Deliverable 1
By using java script we will  remove the list elements to create a button and start to create a filter by editing the index.html
The Filter Search will contain:
- Enter Date
- Enter City
- Enter State
- Enter Country
- Enter Shape
Then the app.js is modified and you add the modified filter changes by using 
updateFilters()
filterTable()

### Deliverable 2
1. Summary
By using JavaScript & index.html on our webpage we will edit each to portray the filters needed to be added. The changes made will make the user on the website more interactive in recieving the data needed by using the filters. The results will be using the filters to search through the UFO data. Dana can now use the information gained to provide to other users to get UFO data needed for professors, future data searching, and researchers that want information on the UFO.

2. Suggestions
The first suggestion would be to have suggestion articles or summaries on the front page that can help future researchers see some options before digging into all the data. Once they use the filtes to start going through the filters it will help them find what they are looking for.

The second suggestion would be that if these filters can help people find specific data easily when looking throught the webpage these changes and modifications made to the website can be used on other websites that contain large data sets or summaries. Scrolling through pages is difficult so these filters will add what they are looking for specifcally.
